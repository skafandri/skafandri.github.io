I am a software engineer from Tunisia. Currently I live in Bucharest, Romania.

I love clean code, challenging problems and automation.
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyeskooli/){:target="_blank"} will be up to date about what I am doing now.

I am an open source enthusiast and casually give back to the community.
You can find my open source work on [Github](https://github.com/skafandri){:target="_blank"}.
